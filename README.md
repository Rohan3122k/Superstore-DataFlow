# Superstore DataFlow: End-to-End ETL Project Using PostgreSQL & PowerBI

## Abstract
This project demonstrates a complete data engineering pipeline built on PostgreSQL to ingest, transform, validate, and automate the processing of Superstore sales data. The pipeline enables real-time updates of sales data from raw to aggregated forms and serves as a robust foundation for supply chain analytics, sales forecasting, and inventory optimization. By leveraging Python (Pandas, SQLAlchemy), PostgreSQL, and Windows Task Scheduler, we simulate a production-ready ETL workflow applicable to real-world business intelligence environments.

## 1. Introduction
Efficient management of sales and inventory data is crucial in domains like retail, supply chain, and operations. This project showcases a working ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using cleaned Superstore sales data. The ETL pipeline is developed to:
Ingest raw CSV data into PostgreSQL.
- Transform it into a monthly summary.
- Validate data integrity with quality checks.
- Automate daily updates using Windows Task Scheduler.
- Such a pipeline can aid business analysts, supply chain managers, and data teams to maintain clean, real-time dashboards and make timely decisions.
